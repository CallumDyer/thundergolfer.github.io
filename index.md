# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, <br/> I'm Jonathon Belotti. 

## Thanks for stopping by.

I'm a software engineer with a focus on data & platform engineering.  


I can usually be found in a programming IDE or reading. 
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

* ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’š [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see [/projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects))
* Good old-fashioned books ðŸ“–. Two recent favourites are [_Dune_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune) and [_Constructing The Political Spectacle_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348524.Constructing_the_Political_Spectacle)
* [Effective Altruism](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/6/20992100/peter-singer-effective-altruism-lives-you-can-save-animal-liberation). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming.
